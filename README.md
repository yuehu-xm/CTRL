The implementation of the **CTRL** model can be found in the [**`model_ctrl.py (Click here)`**](model_ctrl.py) file in this
repository.

## News

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **CTRL** model has been integrated
into [pyFAST: Flexible, Advanced Framework for Multi-source and Sparse Time Series Analysis in PyTorch](https://github.com/freepose/pyFAST).
